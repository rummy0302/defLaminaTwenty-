Animal & Veterinary Service has launched educational programmes and resources to raise awareness on animal ethology, directing this towards young school children. In line with this, learning animal facts can build on a child’s appreciation for other living organisms. Developing a sense of connection between humans and animals will nurture empathy and a sense of caring amongst the younger cohorts of Singapore’s population. Currently, local primary schools teach the classification system and general characteristics of animals. Building on this knowledge with fun facts can spark curiosity about animals and cultivate an appreciation that members of our team felt were lacking in our childhood.

Description of the game -
The game is a series of true and false questions that is single-player, where the primary school student is presented with a statement regarding a specific animal. If they deem the statement to be true, they can press the true button. If they deem it to be false, they can press the false button. If the students are unsure, there is a hint button that gives a brief hint regarding the statement to further aid the students to choose a suitable answer. If the student gets the statement correct, they will proceed on to the next question. If they get it wrong, they will be shown the correct answer and the correct statement along with it. There are 20 questions in the game and after each round of questions, their result will be tallied. Once the student is done with all the questions, their scores will be presented.
